<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>The steps are divided into the preparation stage and cooking stage as you will find in real kitchens. First you set the mise en place with all of your ingredients ready to cook and any garnishes. Then you will start the second stage of cooking. This keeps the process orderly and avoid multitasking. The preparation stage includes some cooking of starches that require only time and no continuous monitoring or agitation.</p>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cook your rice</li>
    <li>Peel and finely chop your garlic</li>
    <li>Combine your chopped garlic, cumin and paprika in a small bowl and set aside</li>
    <li>Drain and rinse your black beans and set aside</li>
    <li>Create your <span class="bold">tomato stock</span> by dissolving your tomato paste and stock cube in 400ml of boiling water, stir with a spoon and set aside</li>
    <li>Once rice has cooked, remove from heat, fluff with a fork and vent</li>
    <li>Gather your garnish ingredients, chop them and put them in separate bowls and put on the serving place</li>
    <li>All ingredients are now prepped, starch is cooked, ready to move onto the cooking phase</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cooking</h4>
<p>These are the items you'll need when you get to the cooking stage of the recipe</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add the oil to a hot saucepan</li>
    <li>Fry the beef mince</li>
    <li>Once brown, add your bowl of garlic and spices and fry for 30 seconds</li>
